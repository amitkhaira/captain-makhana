# 🚀 How to Enable Auto-Deployment (Simple Method)

Since the "GitHub Actions" method was giving errors, we will use the **Standard Method** which is easier.

### 1️⃣ Fix the Settings
1. Go to your repository **Settings** tab:  
   `https://github.com/amitkhaira/captain-makhana/settings/pages`
   
2. Under **"Build and deployment"**:
   - **Source**: Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - **Branch**: Select **"main"**
   - **Folder**: Select **"/(root)"**

3. Click **Save**.

### ✅ Verify
That's it! GitHub will now automatically deploy your site from the main branch.
Wait about 1-2 minutes and refresh the page to see your link:
